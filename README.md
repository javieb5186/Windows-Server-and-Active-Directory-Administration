# Windows Server & Active Directory Administration Home Lab

## Overview

Technical Techno Tech is an enterprise-style IT homelab built to develop hands-on experience with **Windows Server, Active Directory, networking, routing, firewalls, PowerShell, Group Policy, security, and IT administration**.

The environment combines Windows infrastructure with virtual and physical-style network components, including **routers, switches, OPNsense, and VyOS**.

> **For reviewers:** Each project folder contains its own `README.md` documenting the scenario, implementation, commands, testing, troubleshooting, screenshots, and lessons learned. Reading the project READMEs provides a complete walkthrough of the work performed.

# Major Projects

## Network Infrastructure, Routing & Firewalls

Built and configured the network infrastructure supporting the Technical Techno Tech environment.

Major areas include:

- Routers and routing
- Ethernet switching
- Network segmentation
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Default gateways
- OPNsense firewall administration
- VyOS routing
- Firewall rules
- Inter-network communication
- Network troubleshooting
- Connectivity verification

This network infrastructure provides the foundation used by the Windows Server and Active Directory environment.

***

## Active Directory Administration

Built and administered a multi-domain-controller Active Directory environment.

Major tasks include:

- User, computer, group, and OU administration
- PowerShell-based AD management
- Delegation of administrative permissions
- Group types and scopes
- Active Directory replication
- Domain controller administration
- FSMO role management

***

## Group-Based Access Control & File Services

Implemented centralized departmental file access using **AGDLP**:

```text
Accounts → Global Groups → Domain Local Groups → Permissions
```

Configured SMB shares and NTFS permissions for departmental resources and performed positive and negative access testing.

***

## Active Directory Automation

Developed PowerShell workflows for:

- CSV-based employee onboarding
- Automated OU placement
- Security group assignment
- Bulk offboarding
- Account management
- Active Directory audit exports

***

## OU Design, Delegation & Group Policy

Designed an OU structure for centralized administration.

Implemented:

- Organizational Unit design
- Delegation of Control
- Least-privilege help desk permissions
- Group Policy deployment
- GPO testing and validation

***

## Active Directory Sites & Network Topology

Connected Active Directory design with the underlying network infrastructure.

Configured and tested:

- AD Sites
- AD subnet mappings
- Domain Controller Locator
- DNS SRV records
- Site-aware domain controller discovery
- Branch-site simulation

***

## Domain Controller Troubleshooting

Diagnosed Active Directory and Windows Server issues using tools including:

```text
dcdiag
repadmin
w32tm
nltest
nslookup
```

Troubleshooting included resolving a PDC Emulator time synchronization problem involving Windows Time and Hyper-V integration.

***

## Backup, Recovery & Disaster Recovery

Implemented and tested Active Directory protection and recovery concepts including:

- Active Directory Recycle Bin
- Deleted-object recovery
- Windows Server Backup
- System State backup
- DSRM
- Non-authoritative and authoritative restore workflows
- FSMO role transfers
- FSMO seizure concepts
- Disaster recovery planning

***

## Group Policy Processing, Scoping & Inheritance

**Status: In Progress**

Current Group Policy lab topics include:

- Starter GPOs
- GPO links
- Security filtering
- WMI filtering
- User vs Computer Configuration
- LSDOU processing
- Link order and precedence
- GPO inheritance
- Block Inheritance
- Enforced policies
- Group Policy troubleshooting
